DATABASES: PostgreSQL

Currently - once we shut off computer all data disapears.
With database we can save our functions, variables etc.


How to Databases work?

Relational Database:

Non-Relational Database:
It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database


Use SQL (SQL = Structured  Query Language)


Example Excel:

(column:    column:      .       .)
people:
id        name        lname       age  (row / record)
1         bob         bobson      24

USE SELECT BEFORE ANYTHING TO ENSURE NO MISTAKES / OVERWRITING
= Exact math
LIKE with wildcard = Similar to .. that has anything after/before/between % (%something)


CRUD:
Create  - (Insert) - insert cell / row
INSERT INTO <table> (<columns>) VALUES (<values>)

INSERT INTO people (fname, lname, age) VALUES ('Dave', 'Davidson', 45);
[INSERT INTO people (id, fname, lname, age)... (if we control ID, for now leave it!!!!)]




Retrieve - (Select) - select cell / row
SELECT <column> FROM <table>; (or)
SELECT <column> FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;

SELECT: fname, lname FROM people; (select fname and lname from people table)
SELECT * FROM people; (selects all columns from people table)
SELECT * FROM people WHERE age >=25; (selects all people where age is smaller or 25)
SELECT * FROM people WHERE fname LIKE 'bo%' (Like = finds name that are simmilar or like bo)




Update  - (Update) - update
UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value> WHERE <condition>;

UPDATE people SET fname = 'Robert' WHERE id=1




Delete  - (Delete) - delete
DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <condition> (CAN'T DELETE ONE CELL - DELETES ENTIRE ROW / RECORD)
DELETE FROM people WHERE fname = 'Bob' (deletes all rows with bob)



LIMIT = When showing the table, limit to x amount of results
OFFSET = When showing the table, skip x amount and show remaining results





HOW DO DATABASES STORE NULL?
null - if there is no value, database stores it as null






EMPTY DATABASE (pgAdmin)
